# PreemieAlert

As part of the CRI Labs Summer School (https://cri-paris.org/cri-summer-school-2017/) we are developing an accessory for premature babies intended to measure a number of vital signals and to alert parents when abnormal behaviours/values are recorded. The object will be accompanied by an app to advice parents on the behaviour to adopt following different alerts. This product has many aims: reassure parents when the baby comes home after a long hospitalization, bring an additional safety (without replacing the parents' attention), offer a light, easy-to-use and low-cost monitoring method for regions where the health coverage is not sufficient.

The layers are drawn in companionTopsvg, from top to bottom (the one on the right is a draft): 2mm white plexiglass, black paper, 3mm wood and 3mm wood

## DO NOT USE COMPANIONV1_4.STL
This is just an example of a very bad design, our very first try at 3D printing. It's full and there's not space designed for the electronc, useless...
